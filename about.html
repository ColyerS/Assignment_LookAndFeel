                        <br>The assignment took about 6 hours as a group of 3 to complete. We have learned how to write css and html for a simple website as well as imbedding pictures
                        and charts based on data. We would recommend to have more overview of the basics of html and css in class prior to having the assignment to assist with familiarity
