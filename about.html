                        <br>The website has a top navigation for each page that changes color when hovering to facilitate selection of the page.
                        The navigation is consistent throughout the site. If the end user it at the bottom of the page, there are also links to each page
                        to navigate through the footer of the page. This allows the end user to easily go through each of the sites and also go back to previous sites.

                        <br>The assignment took about 6 hours as a group of 3 to complete. We have learned how to write css and html for a simple website as well as imbedding pictures
                        and charts based on data. We would recommend to have more overview of the basics of html and css in class prior to having the assignment to assist with familiarity
